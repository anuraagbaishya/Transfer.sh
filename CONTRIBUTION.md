# Contribution

Open an [issue](https://github.com/kartikarora/Transfer.sh/issues) in order to file a bug or suggest a new feature

If you want to close an issue:

1. Fork the repo
2. Checkout a new branch from dev
3. Work on it
4. Send a pull request(PR)
5. Make sure you reference the issue no in your commit and the PR

Try not to send a pull request from and to master.

A few simple rules to be followed:

1. Avoid tabs, four spaces should be used instead
2. Make sure to test your changes on a physical device as well as emulator
3. Travis-CI has been enabled, so unless it gives a `passing` build status, your PR will not be accepted
